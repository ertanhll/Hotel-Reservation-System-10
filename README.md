Below, you can find the description of your tenth assignment, which also
includes its output in the Application Walkthrough section.
In this assignment, you are expected to improve your existing Hotel
Reservation System by incorporating a graphical user interface where the users
can use mouse and keyboard to input data and get graphical responses.
When the application is executed, the screen below should be displayed to the
user (see Fig 1). Here, please pay attention to the main components that is
incorporated using JFrame; there is a menu bar with three options - namely
File, New and Help- and three buttons, as well as a text area.
Fig 1. Hotel reservation system graphical user interface
The New item in the menu bar, should give the user an option to create a new
Reservation or Extra Service (see Fig 2a). If the user decides to add a new
Reservation, s/he should be prompted to insert the City Name, Hotel Name,
Reservation Month, Reservation Start and Reservation End variables regarding
the Reservation (see Fig 2b and 2c). Once all the variables are collected and the
reservation is generated, if the user clicks on the Display Reservations button,
all reservations that have been created so far should be displayed in the text
area (see Fig 2d).

If the user selects the Services option from the menu as can be seen in Fig 2a,
a JOptionPane should pop up and ask the user whether s/he wants to include
Laundry Service or Spa Service (see Fig 3a) to an existing reservation. If the
user selects the Laundry option by typing in 1, the user needs to provide the
Reservation ID to add the Laundry Service (see Fig 3b) to and also punch in the 
number of clothes s/he would like to use the Laundry Service for. Similarly, if
the user chooses the Spa option, by inserting the number 2, a Reservation ID
should be requested by the application along with the number of days s/he
would like get the Spa Service (see Fig3c). Furthermore, if the user clicks on the
Display Extra Services button, all of the Extra Services that have been added so
far should be displayed in the text area (see Fig 3d).

Last but not least, if the user clicks on the Disp. Res. For City button, the
application should ask the user to provide a city name (see Fig4a) and once the
city is confirmed with a press on the Enter button or a mouse click on the OK
button; all reservations for that city should be displayed in the text area (see
Fig4b).

For other menu bar items, if the user presses on File, then it should show the
Exit option. On the other hand, if the user clicks on the Help menu item, s/he
should be presented with two options: Contents and About. The Contents option
should trigger a pop up that describes how to use the application and the
About option should trigger a pop up window which contains information about
the developer (you are free to write anything you like in these windows).
